Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients arising in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.1 It is named after Blaise Pascal, a French mathematician.01 To build the triangle, start with "1" at the top and continue placing numbers below it in a triangular pattern. Each number is the numbers directly above it added together. If we color the Odd and Even numbers, we end up with a pattern the same as the Sierpinski Triangle. Each entry is also the number of different paths from the top down. Pascal
